Elliptic Curves

Disclaimer
==========
It should be noted up front that this code was not designed for security
focused applications. This was created for research purposes to study a
cetain function that deals with elliptic curves. The math checks out, so one
could use this for some type of security purpose but the code is neither
optimized for performance nor protected in any way from side channel attacks.

Background
==========
This code was created in order to study elliptic curves, and specifically a
hash function onto them. The goal was to improve the coverage of the function.

Usage
=====
The elliptic curve class provides a simple interface to create an elliptic
curve in Weierstrass form and perform addition between two points. The Icart
code implements the hash function of Thomas Icart (the original specification
of which can be found here: https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/226.pdf). The research
called for the counting of collisions in this function, so that is the bulk of
the code in the Icart class. One can also directly apply the function to a
value and hash individual inputs.
